stateless beans:
                -beans that are singleton and are initialized only once.
                -The only state they have is a shared state.
                -These beans are created while the ApplicationContext is being initialized.
                -The SAME bean instance will be returned/injected during the lifetime of this ApplicationContext. .

stateful beans:
                -beans that can carry state (instance variables).
                -These are created every time an object is required.
